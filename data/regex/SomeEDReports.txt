HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Chief complaint:  Chest pain.

This is a **AGE[in 30s]-year-old white female with a past medical history significant for
migraines who presents to the emergency department with a complaint of chest
pain.  Apparently the pain started approximately three days ago.  The pain at
that time was intermittent and lasted minutes at a time, coming and going. 
The pain was not related to exertion or rest.  The pain lasted for a couple
of minutes and then spontaneously resolved.  The patient had about 20 episodes
until today.  The patient states that this morning the pain came on and has
remained constant.  The pain is over her left sternal area.  The pain is worse
with inspiration and with movement.  The patient states that on deep
inspiration she can feel it shoot to her back as well.  The patient denies any
shortness of breath, any cough, any URI symptoms, any lightheadedness, any
palpitations, any nausea or vomiting or any other complaints at this time. 
The patient has not had similar episodes in the past.  The patient can not
relate this to a single episode but states that she feels it may be from her
job of lifting dishes and dietary.

throat. 

GI:  The patient has no nausea or vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation and
no melena or bright red blood per rectum.

GU:  There is no dysuria or hematuria.  Her last menstrual period was
approximately one week ago.

Extremities:  The patient has no lower extremity edema, no calf tenderness.

Skin:  The patient has no rash or ecchymoses.  All other systems are negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Migraines.  

MEDICATIONS:

1. Imitrex.
2. Inderal.
3. Iron.

SOCIAL HISTORY:

The patient does not smoke, drink or use IV drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:

The patient does have a father who died of an MI at 45.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:

The patient had a temperature of 35.2, pulse of 88, respiratory rate of 18 and
BP of 130/palp.  In general, this is an alert and oriented white female in no
apparent distress.  

Head:  Normocephalic.  Ears:  TMs are clear bilaterally.  Eyes:  Pupils are
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Nose: 
No edema or discharge.  Throat:  No edema or exudate.  Neck:  Supple, no JVD
and trachea is midline.

Lungs are clear bilaterally.

Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without rubs, gallops or murmurs.

Abdomen:  Soft, nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.

Extremities:  The patient has no lower extremity edema, no calf tenderness.

Skin:  No rash or ecchymoses.  

Neurologic:  The patient is alert and oriented times three, evaluating      
      without difficulty.  

Chest wall:  The patient has an extremely tender area of tenderness over
approximately her third costochondral region.  The patient's chest wall is
otherwise nontender.  This area completely reproduces her pain and she is
quite tender in that one isolated region.  

ED LABS:  

The patient did have a chest x-ray which revealed no acute disease.

EKG INTERPRETATION:

The patient also had an EKG which showed normal sinus rhythm and no ST segment
abnormalities.  

ED COURSE:

The patient was seen and examined by myself as well as by Dr. **NAME[VVV].  Given
the patient's symptoms of extremely atypical chest pain and lack of risk
factors, as well as her completely reproducible chest pain and normal EKG, it
was felt that she could be safely discharged to home.  The patient will need
to follow up with her primary care physician as soon as possible.  The patient
was agreeable with this plan and she was discharged to home with chest wall
pain instructions and told to take Motrin for any new pain.  The patient was
discharged to home in good condition.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS(ES):

CHEST WALL PAIN.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old woman that I examined here in the Emergency
Department with her son, and examined her myself.  Their recent history
included multiple visits to the hospital.  She has been having chest
discomfort and increased lethargy.  She presents tonight because she has had
progressive congestion.  She is being cared for at home by her son who is with
her and provides most of the history for her.  The patient really cannot
amplify on the history for me.  She had mild shortness of breath.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

The patient, on review of systems, has denied to me any chest pain, any
abdominal pain, any bowel or bladder change, any easy bruising or bleeding. 
She is denying any rash, any change in appetite.  She has had a cough.  Other
systems were negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

My past medical history that I obtained primarily from the chart and from the
son indicates that she has had coronary artery disease, coronary bypass in
**DATE[dec 2000], below-the-knee amputation in **DATE[jul 2001], carotid stenosis, depression,
hypertension, and diabetes.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS ARE LISTED AS:

1. Diltiazem 90 q. six hours.
2. Lopressor 50 q. eight hours.
3. Levaquin 500.
4. Coumadin 5 q.h.s. 
5. Insulin.
6. Iron.
7. Colace.
8. Neurontin.
9. Prozac.
10.Reglan.

FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:

She lives with her son.  She has no substance use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is now 110 systolic.  Heart rate is 58 to 72
while I am at the bedside.  She has sinus process with frequent skipped beats. 


HEENT:  She is normocephalic.  Her neck is supple.  Her trachea is midline. 

RESPIRATORY:  She has got bilateral breath sounds, and a little bit congested
sounding and crackling at the right greater than the left base.  

CARDIAC:  Heart tones are distant.  No rub.

ABDOMEN:  His abdomen soft.

EXTREMITIES:  The extremities are with some peripheral edema. 

NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically, she is intact and moving all of her extremities.
The left leg has got BKA.  

SKIN:  The skin is warm and dry.

ED COURSE:

IMPRESSION:

Per the EKG interpretation, concern is for the heart block which I see on the
monitor.  My impression is CHF versus pulmonary process. 

X-RAY DATA:

I performed a chest x-ray which has some right greater than left basilar
congestion which is concerning for an infiltrate.  

EKG INTERPRETATION:

We did an EKG which shows an intraventricular conduction delay and a second
degree type-2 heart block.  This would be an indication for pacemaker.  Pacer
pads were placed.  

I had an extensive discussion with her son in front of the patient, and also
with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ VVV] who has been following this patient for some time.  There
mutual consensus is that they will no pursue more aggressive cardiac
treatment, and in particular, do not wish pacemaker.  Should the heart require
shocking or pacing, they do not wish this to be initiated.  No electrical
therapy will be initiated.  If there is a cardiac arrest, they do not wish
resuscitation.  At this juncture, will treat her for the possibility of a
pneumonia on the right base.  I am not convinced that his is present, as I
think it is equally likely to be some CHF.  At any rate, until we dry things
out, I will initiate her on an antibiotic, admit her to the hospital on a
monitored bed for diagnostic purposes to ascertain the affects of withholding
her calcium channel blocker and beta blocker, and this was all discussed with
Dr. **NAME[VVV].  The patient remained stable here in the Emergency Department and
is admitted in a fair condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS(ES):

1. PNEUMONIA.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:

I interviewed and examined Mr. **NAME[AAA] as well as reviewed the resident's history
and physical and decision making processes, and concur with them.  Mr. **NAME[AAA]
is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old gentleman who works as a Radiology technician here in the
**INSTITUTION system.  He has a history of MI times four, diabetes mellitus, and
congestive heart failure.  The patient presents with five days of shortness
of breath.  Five days ago, he began with the symptoms what he describes as
flu-like symptoms.  He reports fevers, chills, cough, congestion, and
rhinorrhea.  He states the cough is productive for green sputum.  He contacted
Dr. **NAME[WWW] who placed him on a Z-pak.  The patient is in day four of the Z-pak
and states no improvement in his symptoms.  His shortness of breath has grown
progressively worse over the last three days, and he has continued to have
fever and chills.  He contacted his physician again and was told to come to
the emergency department over a concern for possible congestive heart failure. 

Physical examination shows a middle-aged white male in minor to moderate
respiratory distress.  His O2 saturation is 95% on room air.  Neck is supple. 
Lungs show diffuse wheezes and rhonchi throughout with moderate air movement. 
The patient did report some improvement in his breathing symptoms with a
nebulized treatment.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia, no
murmurs were noted.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.

ED course:  The patient had a 12-lead ECG which showed:

EKG INTERPRETATION:

A normal sinus rhythm, rate of 94, with an intraventricular block which is
old.  There are old Q-waves in V5 and V6.  There is no new acute ischemic
changes.

Chest x-ray shows diffuse alveolar infiltrates bilaterally.  Laboratory
studies are as noted in the resident's note. 

Dr. **NAME[WWW]'s partner was contacted and agrees with admitting to the hospital. 
We will him on Levaquin here in the emergency department.  At the time the
patient was transferred to the floor, he did have some improvement in his
respiratory symptoms when compared to when he arrived in the emergency
department.
