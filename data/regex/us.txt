A carotid u/s showed ""no changes from previous"", but by report, 
 unsure of previous findings.

Carotid dopplers ([**1-30**]) notable for 60-69%R ICA occlusion and 
 L-vertebral not visualized (so could be occulded or hypoplastic)

Ultrasound of the carotids revealed right ICA with 80-99% occlusion and L ICA with 40% 
 occlusion.

IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Occluded left-sided ICA and left-sided vertebral artery.
 
 2. 70-79% right ICA stenosis.
 
 3. Near occlusion of the right external carotid artery.
 

IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at 
 the bifurcation. 2. High-grade stenosis of the right internal 
 carotid bifurcation. Normal right vertebral artery. 3. Diffuse 
 atherosclerotic disease involving left vertebral artery with 
 partial visualization in the proximal and distal portions.
 
 MRA OF THE HEAD:
 
 The head MRA demonstrates absence of flow signal in the distal 
 left internal carotid artery. The supraclinoid internal carotid 
 artery is minimally visualized with flow visualized from the 
 left PCA to the left middle cerebral artery. On the right side 
 normal flow signal is seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid, 
 right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior 
 communicating artery is also visualized on the right side.
 
 In the posterior circulation, diffuse narrowing of the basilar 
 artery is visualized with absence of flow signal in the distal 
 basilar artery indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
 with high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the distal basilar 
 artery. Both distal vertebral arteries demonstrate narrowed flow 
 signal caliber.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid with collateral flow 
 to the left MCA through the left posterior communicating artery. 
 Normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid internal carotid, 
 right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. Diffuse 
 atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery with probable 
 occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the distal basilar artery.

IMPRESSION: Normal study.
 
  Carotid US showed no appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving either 
 carotid system.
 Carotid U/S [**2-25**]: NO significant stenosis


 Angio of chest: suggestion of a 50% stenosis 
 in the distal right CCA just below the level of the bulb with a 
 significant amount of soft tissue plaque. Possible moderate to
 severe stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery 
 with soft and hard plaque present. Atherosclerotic plaque noted 
 at the level of the thoracic arch.

IMPRESSION:  Moderate plaque with bilateral 60-69% carotid 
 stenosis. 

IMPRESSION:  50-60% stenosis at the distal right common carotid 
 artery.  Mild atherosclerotic disease at left common, internal 
 carotid.  Normal vertebral arteries. 

IMPRESSION: Normal carotid ultrasound. No evidence of 
 hemodynamically significant stenosis.

He was imaged and
 found to have  complete occlusion of the L ICA at the 
 bifurcation
 as well as R ICA stenosis in the cavernous portion.
 
 
 He also had a carotid ultrasound that reported carotid stenosis 
 with velocities >200 specially on the left side.

IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid 
 stenosis.

Carotid US 
 were done, these showed <40% bilateral carotid stenosis..
