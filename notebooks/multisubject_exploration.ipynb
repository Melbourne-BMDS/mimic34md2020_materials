    "# Comparing Data Across Subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a small tweak from `explore_mimic_data.ipynb` in that it allows you to select multiple subjects and compare data values across the subjects. Because every patient has a random time shift, it is not straightforward to compare time series (although I'm working on it!). Instead we will look at distributions and counts of the events and values.\n",

    "## Questions to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "### `DRG` values\n",
    "In the far right of the tabs below there is a tab labeled `DRG`. This shows the Diagnosis-related group (`DRG`) codes for each patient. A `DRG` code of 1.0, means this patient's combined medical conditions would be expected to lead to hospitalization costs of an average US patient. `DRG` values greater than 1.0, mean the patient would be expected to have hospitalization costs greater than average (proportional to the `DRG` value) and `DRG` values less than 1.0 should similarly be less expensive. In this data set `DRG` values range from from 0.72  to 19.80. By comparing subjects with a range of `DRG` values, can you come up with explanations for the cost differences? Radiology procedures can incur high costs as can drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infections\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests for infectious agents are shown in the `microbiology_events` table. Tests with missing values are test that did not identify any known pathogens. What are the most common pathogens `organism_name` across patients? Do higher `DRG` subjects have different pathogens? What are the frequently used antibiotics? Do the antibiotics show up on this chart of antibiotics and their costs?\n",
    "\n",
    "![antibiotic costs vs date of introduction](https://cddep.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/etcfig1-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `interpretation` values of `S` sensitive and `R` resistant indicate whether an organism was sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic. Can you spot any patterns of resistant antibiotics in the subjects?\n",
