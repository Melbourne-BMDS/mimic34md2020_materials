question: '#### Data and Metadata Brainstorming


  _Nothing seems to be a datum per se. Rather, being a datum is an external property._
  (Floridia)


  What we consider to be data and what we consider to be metadata may be question-dependent.


  We used the example of blood pressure with the numeric value of "132" as the primary
  data and "mmHg" as metadata.


  Think of the administration of a medication to a patient. Consider the chemical
  formula of the drug as the primary data, write down all the different data that
  might be considered metadata for a drug administration to a patient in the ICU.

      - Dose

      - The time it was administered'

question: '#### GDI


  According to the general definition of information (GDI), what is the most likely
  explanation of why the following would not be viewed as valid blood pressure information:


  10599.13 / 17651.884 Pa'
responses:
  Pascals are not a medically meaningful unit of measurement.:
    feedback: By convention we use mmHg, but Pascals are actually the SI unit of pressure
      with a well defined conversion to mmHg.
    status: false
  The data are not well formed, because the diastolic pressure is listed over the systolic pressure.:
    feedback: ''
    status: true
  The primary data need to be integers.:
    feedback: While blood pressure might commonly be recorded using whole numbers,
      as a measured value real numbers would actually be the most appropriate.
    status: false
  The values are not within a physiologically valid range.:
    feedback: The pressures correspond to roughly 79.5 mmHg and 132 mmHg.

      First, I used the distinct() method find all the unique care giver labels.


      ```Python

      tnew.cg_label.distinct().execute()

      ```


      Then I formed a filter using the values that I guessed represented an RT.


      ```Python

      tnew.filter(tnew.cg_label.like(["RRT", "RT", "RTH", "RTStu", "RTS", "RRTs"])).cg_label.count().execute(limit=None)

      ```


      Unless `execute` is passed a limit of `None`, the number of results is limited
      to a set value.'
