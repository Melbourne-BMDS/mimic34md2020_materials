    "# Overview\n",
    "As we saw in the last notebook, spaCy doesn't work great for clinical text out of the box. We're interested in extracting different types of information from clinical text than news or Wikipedia articles. Clinical text is also very different from general domain language. \n",
    "- **It is very messy**, with semi-structured formatting from EHR\n",
    "- Clinical documents include **many abbreviations**, some of which are ambiguous\n",
    "- There are **specific tasks** needed in clinical NLP, such as **detecting negation or uncertainty** for concepts in the text\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful components of spaCy is that is **very customizable**. In addition to working with the default models provided in the core library, you can create your own [custom components](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components) or add your own [extension attributes](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components-attributes). Developers and researchers can then publish their spaCy extensions to the open-source community. Some examples of these openly available libraries are:\n",

    "- [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/): Includes models trained on biomedical literature\n",
    "- [medCAT](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT): Models trained for medical concept extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two notebooks, we'll use [medspacy](https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy), a newly released package for performing clinical NLP tasks in spaCy. \n",

    "[Medspacy](https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy) is an open-source package maintained by NLP developers at the University of Utah and the US Department of Veterans Affairs. The goal of medSpaCy is to provide flexible, easy-to-use spaCy components for common clinical NLP tasks, such as:\n",
